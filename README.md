# PSoC_5_Assignment
The assignment 5 is made of 3 projects: 
the project 1 is made to implement the multiwrite and multiread functions of registers. 
in the project 2 the accelerometer output capabilities have to be tested, in particular we have to set the control registers to output 3 Axis accelerometer data in Normal Mode at 100 Hz in the ±2.0 g FSR and then send the values to Bridge Control Panel, setting the UART Serial Communication in the correct way.
in the project 3 we have to read accelerometer output in m/s2, so we need to transform the given acceleration vale in mg into m/s2 values and cast the floating point values to an int variable without losing information. In this project we set the control register to output a 3 Axis Signal in High Resolution Mode at 100 Hz in the ±4.0 g FSR. Also here, in the end the values are sent to Bridge Control Panel, paying attention on setting the UART serial communication in the right way.
